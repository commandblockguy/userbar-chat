# Userbar Chat
*another entry in the "commandblockguy blantantly abuses web technologies for his own personal amusement" series*

A read-only no-JS IRC client that fits in a forum userbar, which works by streaming a APNG over a long-running connection.

Features an entirely custom PNG implementation, which is likely to completely fall apart at the slightest touch.

Try it out here, if GitHub doesn't try to rehost my stuff:
