# Userbar Chat
*another entry in the "commandblockguy blantantly abuses web technologies for his own personal amusement" series*

A read-only no-JS IRC client that fits in a forum userbar, which works by streaming a APNG over a long-running connection.

Features an entirely custom PNG implementation, which is likely to completely fall apart at the slightest touch.
